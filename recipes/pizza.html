        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of course!.</p>
        <p>Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza.</p>
        <p>I told him if he helped me make it I would talk about him on my website and he would be famous. That seemed to get his attention. He thought the dough was "slimy and gross" but he loved picking his own toppings, and the finished product was "awesome".</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)</li>
                <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy..</li>
                <li>Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.

                    Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake pizza in the 475Â°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
            </ol>
